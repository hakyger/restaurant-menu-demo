			into one location. Not only do we feel we successfully do that, but being 
			located in Myrtle Beach offers a family friendly atmosphere with other 
			attractions for you and your friends or family to enjoy. </p>

			<h5> Added Bootstrap Features </h5>
				<p> For the Bootstrap feature of my choose that I was able to add, I chose to change 
				the "more details" ingredients sections to use the Bootstrap Collapsible 
				feature. I felt this looked more smooth than the original "detail" property feature 
				that was previously being used. In addition, I also centered all of the food images using the "center-block" class 
				attribute and changed the font design of the allergy warning ingredients to have the "text-danger" 
				class attribute so they would appear in red. </p>

		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h5> Color Scheme </h5>
				<p> For the color I used an analogous color scheme. The three colors I chose
				to work with were #de5c4b, #de814b, #de4b72. These three colors
				sat adjacent to each other on the color wheel. I feel the three colors I
				chose compliment each other very well, but also are fun and inviting for
				users viewing the website. I feel these colors give off a welcoming vibe
				to customers and make the website look fun and exciting. I just to use
				the analogous color scheme because I felt many of the other color schemes
				appeared to be too all over the place. When I tried some of the other
				color schemes, the website looked very distracting with all of the 
				contrasting colors and the focus appeared to be all over the place. I feel
				the color scheme I chose with the colors I used appears both inviting
				and exciting.
