# restaurant-menu-demo
The files within this repository are from a fake restaurant menu I made for CSCI 120.
Each HTML file represents a page from the restaurant.
Ideally, you can navigate through each without being on the first "about.html" page once on and viewing the website.
The remaining folders that are not ".html" pages are different images, styles, scripts, and media referenced and used within the HTML pages.
